# disease Tracker
Disease diagnosis system using ML algorithms
A basic Python script that uses K-means clustering to diagnose a disease based on user-entered symptoms. The program assigns a 1 or 0 to each symptom based on user input, compares it with pre-defined data for various diseases, and predicts which disease the user may have. The program outputs the predicted disease name.
